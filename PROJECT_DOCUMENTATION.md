- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4 with custom components
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Heroicons

#### Key Implementation Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring compatibility across devices
- **Authentication Context**: Centralized user authentication state management
- **Route Protection**: Automatic redirection for unauthorized users
- **Role-Based UI**: Dynamic interface based on user permissions

#### Frontend Configuration Example
```javascript
// API Configuration
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:5001/api",
  timeout: 30000,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});

// Authentication interceptor
api.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = getToken();
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

### Backend Implementation

#### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Express.js 4.18
- **Database ODM**: Mongoose 8.0
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI SDK

#### Key Implementation Components

##### Authentication System
```javascript
// JWT Configuration
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
const JWT_EXPIRES_IN = process.env.JWT_EXPIRES_IN || '7d';

// Password hashing
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(12);
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
```

##### Database Configuration
```javascript
// MongoDB Connection
const connectDatabase = async () => {
  try {
    const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI);
    logger.info(`MongoDB Connected: ${conn.connection.host}`);
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Database connection failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};
```

##### AI Service Integration
```javascript
// Gemini AI Service
const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require('@google/generative-ai');

class GeminiService {
  constructor() {
    this.genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
    this.model = this.genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-flash" });
  }

  async generateRemediationSuggestions(caseData) {
    const prompt = this.buildRemediationPrompt(caseData);
    const result = await this.model.generateContent(prompt);
    return this.parseRemediationResponse(result.response.text());
  }
}
```

### Database Implementation

#### Schema Design
The system uses MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for flexible document-based storage:

##### User Schema
```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, enum: ['admin', 'senior_analyst', 'analyst'] },
  performance: {
    totalCasesAssigned: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    totalCasesResolved: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    avgResolutionTime: { type: Number, default: 0 }
  }
}, { timestamps: true });
```

##### Case Schema
```javascript
const caseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  caseId: { type: String, unique: true },
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  priority: { type: String, enum: ['P1', 'P2', 'P3'] },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['Open', 'In Progress', 'Resolved', 'Closed'] },
  aiAssistant: {
    remediationSuggestions: [String],
    executiveSummary: String,
    complianceChecks: [Object]
  }
}, { timestamps: true });
```

### Security Implementation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Middleware for permission checking
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

#### Security Middleware Configuration
```javascript
// Helmet security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"]
    }
  }
}));

// Rate limiting
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later."
});
```

### AI Integration Implementation

#### Google Gemini AI Configuration
The system integrates with Google's Gemini AI for intelligent case analysis:

```javascript
// Executive Summary Generation
buildExecutiveSummaryPrompt(caseData) {
  return `You are writing a comprehensive executive security report for senior leadership...
  
  Create a complete executive report with this exact structure in markdown format:
  
  # Security Incident Executive Report
  **Case ID: ${caseData.caseId}**
  **Report Date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}**
  
  ## Executive Summary
  [Business-focused incident description]
  
  ## Business Impact Assessment
  [Risk and financial implications]
  
  ## Recommendations for Leadership
  [Strategic decisions needed]`;
}
```
